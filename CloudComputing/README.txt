Below is the procedure to run the code.

There are two different files of code which has two different methods of migration implemented.

( cloudvehicle.cpp and cloudvehicle_arrival_time.cpp)

Both the files are to be run in the same way. 

1. Place the code file in public_html folder (creating a local copy) and using Secure Shell Client, change the directory to public_html and futher wherever the code file is located within the public_html folder.

2. Run the following commands -
	$ g++ cloudvehicle.cpp
	$ ./a.out

3. This will lead to a question - Would you like to continue?(0/1)

Press 1 to continue and 0 to terminate the simulation.

4. This creates a lot of text files in the same folder which are the outputfiles.
